        "content": " Certainly! Below is an example of a Python script that reads names from a list, assigns each name a random number, and then prints the results. This example uses the `random` module to generate random numbers.\n\n```python\nimport random\n\n# List of names\nnames = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"]\n\n# Dictionary to store the assigned numbers\nname_to_number = {}\n\n# Assign a random number between 1 and 100 to each name\nfor name in names:\n    # Generate a random number between 1 and 100 (inclusive)\n    random_number = random.randint(1, 100)\n    # Store the random number in the dictionary with the name as the key\n    name_to_number[name] = random_number\n\n# Print the results\nfor name, number in name_to_number.items():\n    print(f\"{name} has been assigned the number {number}\")\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n1. Imports the `random` module.\n2. Defines a list of names.\n3. Creates an empty dictionary to store the assigned numbers.\n4. Iterates over each name in the list, generates a random number between 1 and 100, and assigns it to the corresponding name in the dictionary.\n5. Prints out the names along with their assigned numbers.\n\nYou can run this script, and it will output something like:\n```\nAlice has been assigned the number 42\nBob has been assigned the number 78\nCharlie has been assigned the number 93\nDavid has been assigned the number 17\nEve has been assigned the number 65\n```\n\nFeel free to modify the list of names or adjust the range for the random numbers as needed."
