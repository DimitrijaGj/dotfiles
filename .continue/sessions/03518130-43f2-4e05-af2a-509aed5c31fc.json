        "content": " To solve this problem in Python, you need to calculate the total cost of a meal by considering its base price, tip percentage, and tax percentage. The formula for calculating the total cost is as follows:\n\n1. Calculate the tip amount: `tip_amount = meal_price * (tip_percent / 100)`\n2. Calculate the tax amount: `tax_amount = meal_price * (tax_percent / 100)`\n3. Add the tip and tax to the base price to get the total cost: `total_cost = meal_price + tip_amount + tax_amount`\n4. Round the total cost to the nearest integer using the `round()` function.\n\nHere's a Python function that implements this logic:\n\n```python\ndef solve(meal_price, tip_percent, tax_percent):\n    # Calculate the tip and tax amounts\n    tip_amount = meal_price * (tip_percent / 100)\n    tax_amount = meal_price * (tax_percent / 100)\n    \n    # Calculate the total cost\n    total_cost = meal_price + tip_amount + tax_amount\n    \n    # Round to the nearest integer and return the result\n    return round(total_cost)\n\n# Example usage:\nmeal_price = 100\ntip_percent = 15\ntax_percent = 8\nprint(solve(meal_price, tip_percent, tax_percent))  # Output will be 123\n```\n\nIn this example, the `solve` function is called with a meal price of 100, a tip percentage of 15%, and a tax percentage of 8%. The function calculates the total cost by adding the tip and tax to the base price and then rounds the result to the nearest integer."
